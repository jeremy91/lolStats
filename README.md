# lolStats
A simple app that pulls your statistics for a game called league of legends.

This app takes in a username and a region. It then takes the user to their 10 most current games and displays details of the game.
At the bottom of the page it also shows a graph which displays your total number of kills, deaths and assists for those 10 games.

To run this app, start up your local server and make sure landingPage.html is in its path.
